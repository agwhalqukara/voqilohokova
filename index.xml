Answer
Will the state of California (or any other state) compensate or credit you for homeschooling your children? No. Schooling is supported by the federal government, and schools are paid per pupil.
Is it true that the state pays you to homeschool? Homeschooling is not covered by the government, and you and your family are responsible for any costs related with it. There are, however, public schools that provide homeschooling.</description></item><item><title>Jon Rahm Weight Loss | Before And After Photo</title><link>/jon-rahm-weight-loss-before-and-after-photo.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/jon-rahm-weight-loss-before-and-after-photo.html</guid><description>Jon Rahm weight loss: the Spanish golfer has had tremendous success on the course.
