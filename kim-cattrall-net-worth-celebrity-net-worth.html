She is best known for her role as Samantha Jones on HBO's "Sex and the City" but has enjoyed a multi-decade film and television career, particularly in the 1980s.

She is the daughter of secretary Gladys Shane and construction engineer Dennis Cattrall. When she was three months old, her family moved to Canada and settled in British Columbia. At age 11, she returned to Liverpool when her grandmother fell ill.</p><p>She took acting classes at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), but moved back to Canada after just one year. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>Cattrall graduated early from Georges P.

Two years later, she had a role in the original "Police Academy." In 1986, she played <a href=# title="Kurt Russell Net Worth">Kurt Russell</a>'s fling in the action film "Big Trouble in Little China." Her starring role in "Mannequin" in 1987 gained Cattrall further recognition.</p><p>Cattrall had dozens of TV and movie credits to her name when she was cast as Samantha Jones on the hit HBO series "Sex and the City" with co-stars <a href=# title="Sarah Jessica Parker Net Worth">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, <a href=# title="Kristin Davis Net Worth">Kristin Davis</a> and <a href=# title="Cynthia Nixon Net Worth">Cynthia Nixon</a>.

In 2002, she clinched the Golden Globe win for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She reprised her role in the film version of "Sex and the City" in 2008 and again for the sequel "Sex and the City 2" in 2010.

In 2006, Cattrall starred in a West End drama revival of "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" She was in another West End production later that year, <a href=# title="David Mamet Net Worth">David Mamet</a>'s "The Cryptogram."

That amount was one-third of the $1 million that Sarah Jessica Parker was paid per episode at the time.</p><p>For the first Sex and the City movie, Kim was paid $7 million, while Sarah was paid $13 million. Kim earned $10 million for the second film. These financial discrepancies caused quite a bit of stress between the cast members. Kim and Sara Jessica Parker famously had a massive falling-out at some point after second film. Their relationship was so bad that Kim was not invited to appear in 2021's 10-episode revival series "And Just Like Thatâ€¦". While her former cast members each earned $1 million per episode of the revival, Kim was not involved at all and was in fact written off as having died.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Kim Cattrall has been married three times and has no children.

She wrote a book about her sex life with her third husband, audio designer and jazz bassist Mark Levinson, called "Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm". They were married from 1998-2004. Cattrall briefly dated former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.</p><p>The enthusiastic Liverpool F.C. fan splits her time between New York City and the East Hamptons. She holds British and Canadian citizenship, and in August 2020 became an American citizen.</p><p>On December 21, 1988, Cattrall was booked on Pan AM flight 103 from London to New York. She missed her flight because she made a last minute decision to go shopping at the department store Harrods to get a teapot for her mother. She re-booked herself on a flight that departed Heathrow airport 45 minutes after Pan AM 103 departed. When she landed in New York, she learned that her original flight had been brought down by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board.</p><p>In February 2018, Cattrall tweeted the public asking for help. Her brother Christopher had gone missing in Alberta, Canada. He was sadly found dead several hours later, having committed suicide.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1998 Kim paid $420,000 for a waterfront home in East Hampton, New York. Kim listed this home for sale in October 2020 for $3.25 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLiquYycmK2sopa5rXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Kim%20Cattrall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kim%20Cattrall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kim%20Cattrall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kim%20Cattrall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-cattrall-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Kim%20Cattrall%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./randy-orton-shit-s-gonna-get-a-little-crazy-when-i-face-the-fiend-bad-bunny-is-officially.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Randy Orton: Shits Gonna Get A Little Crazy When I Face The Fiend, Bad Bunny Is Officially ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kara-del-toro-in-bathing-suit-shares-cabo-dump-celebwell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kara Del Toro in Bathing Suit Shares &amp;quot;Cabo Dump&amp;quot;  Celebwell">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
