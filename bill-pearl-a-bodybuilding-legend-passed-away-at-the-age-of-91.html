Judy, his wife, broke the news on his official social media account. His most recent post included the news of his death with his biography, and the caption began:</p><p>“Bill Pearl… “A Life Well Lived.”</p><h2>Bill Pearl’s cause of death</h2><p>His wife did not divulge the reason for her death when paying respect to Pearl. She did, however, explain that his Parkinson’s condition had overcome him. In 2016, he was diagnosed with the condition. Furthermore, in April 2022, the bodybuilder was involved in a mowing accident in which the mower collapsed on top of him. The accident was also announced on his Facebook page. Following the event, he sustained a compression fracture on his T-10 vertebrae, as well as a few other issues. A few days later, though, a neck fracture was discovered.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bill-Pearl-2.jpg alt="Bill Pearl" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Everything there is to know about Bill Pearl</h2><p>Bill Pearl, who was born on October 31, 1930, joined the United States Navy and was assigned to the San Diego Naval Air Station. He used to work out at Leo Stern’s Gym, where he met Pearl’s mentor, Leo Stern, who was also a bodybuilder.&nbsp;Pearl participated in two local events in 1952 and four in 1953, winning both of them. He has even crowned Mr. America and Mr. Universe. From 1956 through 1971, he competed in 11 different events, winning nine of them. Bill rose to prominence after defeating bodybuilders such as Frank Zane, Reg Park, Dave Draper, and Sergio Oliva. In several nations, he performed posing and strongman demonstrations. In his strongman routines, he would blow up hot water bottles, bend tent spikes, shatter shackles, and rip license plates.</p><p>He ran two gyms in California and became a vegetarian when he was 39. He used to eat dairy and eggs, and the advantages of doing so were discussed in his book, Getting Stronger: Weight Training for Sports.&nbsp;Pearl’s first book was Getting Stronger: Weight Training for Men and Women, and his second was Keys To The Inner Universe. This was followed by his question-and-answer pieces in MuscleMag International and Muscle Builder, two bodybuilding publications.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bill-Pearl-1.jpg alt="Bill Pearl" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2003, he and co-author Kim Shott released their autobiography, Beyond the Universe: The Bill Pearl Story. During the 1980s, he was a mentor and teacher to many pros, and he got the Arnold Schwarzenegger Classic Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004. In 2011, he was featured in the documentary Challenging Impossibility.</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Bill has become a household name throughout the years as a faultless bodybuilder. When word of his death spread, Twitter was inundated with tributes. Judy, his wife, is one of his survivors. As previously said, no information concerning his funeral has been released.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>RIP BILL PEARL (1930-2022)</p><p>Bodybuilding icon from the Golden Age, wrote the best illustrated guide to exercise ever written. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Hn7mOfrBgx</a></p><p>— Alexander Cortes PhD, Fitness, Nutrition, Fat loss (@AJA_Cortes) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 14, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Sad to advise that the legendary Bill Pearl has passed away. 7 weeks shy of his 92nd birthday.
