During the time he was married to <a href=#>Denise Lombardo</a> from 1985 to 1991 and then <a href=#>Nadine Caridi</a> 1991 to 1998.</p><p>The couple, Anne and Jordan Belfort relationship came into existence when Belfort was trying to straighten his life. He had served 22 months jail time relating to penny stock scam (which caused his investors to lose about $200M) and other fraud. After coming out, Belfort turned into a writer and motivational speaker. Along the way, he met Anne in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Anne-Koppe-and-Jordan-Belfort.jpg><p>In short time the couple began dating, and their relationship flourished. After four years of relationship in 2012&nbsp; Belfort made his girlfriend into finance. The two has not shared much about their engagement details like the ring size or what Belfort has to offer to his better half. However, the important thing is the lovers gave a new name to their well-tuned love life.</p><p>Anne is a supportive partner in many ways&nbsp;to Belfort. She&nbsp;is a helping hand in&nbsp;his&nbsp;business venture also&nbsp;she&nbsp;is supportive by&nbsp;being vocal about&nbsp;him and how he has transformed to be a good citizen.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>In</a> a letter, she wrote&nbsp;to the judge;</p><p>“Jordan is no longer a criminal, he is an exemplary contributor to the economy. He is a taxpayer and a very hard-working man.”</p><p>Also, Anne has taken to Facebook several times to <a href=# rel=noopener>defend</a> her longtime lover and finance for the hatred and criticism he receives for the mistakes he did in the past.
